The template section is a bit special because it is not interpreted the same way as the other sections. As long as it is grammatically correct it's fine, even if it doesn't make any sense.
A template is simply taken and transformed into another language without interpreting or attempting to make any sense if the destination language. The generated code might not compile.

If you create your own template you need to know the destination language to make compilable and executable code. If you reuse someone else's template you don't have too if the template is well documented.
