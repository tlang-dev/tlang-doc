[{"content":"The TLang code is written in .tlang files. They are composed of different parts that are not mandatory. The first part is the context of the file, mainly the packages that are imported or exposed. More will be said latter.\nThen in the sections of the file are described. There are three types:\n model, it represents the objects and the structure of your program helper, it contains the logic. Everything that will be executed is written in this section template, it defines the templates that will be used to generate the final code  You don\u0026rsquo;t need to use all of them in every file. It is actually a good practice to separate correctly the different sections, especially if your project grows fast.\nThis is an example of an tlang file:\nuse myFile1\rexpose myFunc\rmodel {\r}\rhelper {\r}\rtmpl[java] {\r}\rAt that point, this program does nothing, it won\u0026rsquo;t even run but it shows the different parts.\n","description":"Language specification overview","id":0,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Overview","uri":"https://tlang.dev/docs/specs/overview/"},{"content":"Make sure that you have java version 11 or above installed.\nDownload the latest version of TLang https://github.com/tlang-dev/tlang/releases\nThen run the jar:\n1  java -jar tlang.jar version   Set env We advise you to set an environment variable to run the jar. in the next chapters we will use the command tlang instead of java -jar tlang.jar\nUnix On unix systems add a path to your PATH variable in your shell config file.\nWindows For Windows you need to create a batch file (for instance: C:\\Users\\YOUR_NAME\\tools\\tlang\\tlang.bat):\n1  java -jar C:\\Users\\YOUR_NAME\\tools\\tlang\\tlang.jar %*   Then add the folder to your Path in your environment variables (C:\\Users\\YOUR_NAME\\tools\\tlang).\n","description":"Installing TLang","id":1,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Installation","uri":"https://tlang.dev/docs/gettingstarted/installation/"},{"content":"Multi-languages\n","description":"Multi-language support","id":2,"section":"features","tags":null,"title":"Multi-languages","uri":"https://tlang.dev/features/multi-languages/"},{"content":"Classic \u0026ldquo;Hello, World\u0026rdquo; Main.tlang:\nuse io.Terminal\rhelper {\rfunc main() {\rTerminal.println(\u0026quot;Hello, World !\u0026quot;)\r}\r}\rmanifest.yaml\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  name:HelloWorldproject:IntegrationTestsorganisation:TLangversion:1.0.0stability:alphareleaseNumber:1dependencies:- TLang/IO/Terminal 1.0.0:alpha:1 io  Generate \u0026ldquo;Hello, World\u0026rdquo; in Scala Main.tlang:\nuse io.Terminal\ruse gen.Generator\rhelper {\rfunc main() {\rTerminal.println(Generator.generate(helloWorld()))\r}\r}\rtmpl[scala] helloWorld {\rpkg hello_world\rimpl HelloWorld {\rfunc main(args: String[]) {\rprintln(\u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;)\r}\r}\r}\rmanifest.yaml\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  name:HelloWorldInScalaproject:IntegrationTestsorganisation:TLangversion:1.0.0stability:alphareleaseNumber:1dependencies:- TLang/IO/Terminal 1.0.0:alpha:1 io- TLang/Generator/Generator 1.0.0:alpha:1 gen  To run this example, in your favourite terminal, go to the folder where you saved these files and then run:\n1  tlang run .
